# Analog Kickdrum Design
Project-2 of EW-2 (EC2.202), Spring 2025. The design goes over the design *(included in report)*, simulation and control being created over various parameters of a drumbeat generation:

## Potentiometer Controls
- Envelope
- Pitch
- Decay
- Tone & Distortion

## Control Voltage (CV)
- Pitch (Intensity)
- Accent

We make some adjustments after the final output to prepare the circuit for an LM386N IC to 4Î© speaker load.

## Report
All details related to the project are included in `kickdrum_report`. Components used are included in the corresponding folder.

The project is based on an implementation by [*Moritz Klein*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz37Yz315eU).
